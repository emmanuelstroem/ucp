Uganda Cancer Portal


This is a project for any cancer clinic out there to store population data.
Everyone who visits the clinic is registered regardless of their cancer state.

A follow up process then continues for patients who have been diagnosed with cancer.

#Departments
The system consists of several departments:
<ol>
  <li>Reception - Where the client registration is done</li>
  <li>Nurse - Where the traige is taken and recorded</li>
  <li>Doctor - Where the Screenin requests, diagnosis, treatment and appointments are set</li>
  <li>Screening - Where the actual screening takes place and results fed into the system</>
  <li>Pharmacy - Where the drug dispensing is done</li>
</ol>



#SCREENING

Staging(Tumor, Node, Metastasis):
This system uses numerals I, II, III, and IV (plus the 0) to describe the progression of cancer.


Clinical Stage (c):
 - this is based on all of the available information obtained before a surgery to remove the tumor. 

Pathological Stage (p):
- adds additional information gained by examination of the tumor microscopically by a pathologist.


#Stage Grouping:
<ul>
<li>Stage 0: carcinoma in situ.</li>

<li>Stage I: cancers are localized to one part of the body. Stage I cancer can be surgically removed if small enough.</li>

<li>Stage II: cancers are locally advanced. Stage II cancer can be treated by chemo, radiation, or surgery.</li>

<li>Stage III: cancers are also locally advanced. Whether a cancer is designated as Stage II or Stage III can depend on the specific type of cancer; for example, in Hodgkin's Disease, Stage II indicates affected lymph nodes on only one side of the diaphragm, whereas Stage III indicates affected lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The specific criteria for Stages II and III therefore differ according to diagnosis. Stage III can be treated by chemo, radiation, or surgery.</li>

<li>Stage IV: cancers have often metastasized, or spread to other organs or throughout the body. Stage IV cancer can be treated by chemo, radiation, or surgery.</li>
